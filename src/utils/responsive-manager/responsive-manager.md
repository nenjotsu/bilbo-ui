@# Responsive Manager
A utility class that provides a simple wrapper over the <a href="https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js/">enquire.js</a> library for detecting media query changes. Note: must be explicitly initialized, preferably somewhere in your app root file.

import { ResponsiveManager } from 'construct-ui';
ResponsiveManager.initialize();
```
